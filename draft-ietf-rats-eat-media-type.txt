Abstract

   Payloads used in Remote Attestation Procedures may require an
   associated media type for their conveyance, for example when used in
   RESTful APIs.

   This memo defines media types to be used for Entity Attestation
   Tokens (EAT).

    Figure 1: Conveying RATS conceptual messages in REST APIs using EAT

   This memo defines media types to be used for Entity Attestation Token
   (EAT) [EAT] payloads independently of the RATS Conceptual Message in
   which they manifest themselves.  The objective is to give protocol,
   API and application designers a number of readily available and
   reusable media types for integrating EAT-based messages in their
   flows, for example when using HTTP [BUILD-W-HTTP] or CoAP [REST-IoT].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   This document uses the terms and concepts defined in [RATS-Arch].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  EAT Types

   Figure 2 illustrates the six EAT wire formats and how they relate to
   each other.  [EAT] defines four of them (CWT, JWT and Detached EAT
   Bundle in its JSON and CBOR flavours), whilst [UCCS] defines the
   remaining two: UCCS and UJCS.

3.  A Media Type Parameter for EAT Profiles

   EAT is an open and flexible format.  To improve interoperability,
   Section 6 of [EAT] defines the concept of EAT profiles.  Profiles are
   used to constrain the parameters that producers and consumers of a
   specific EAT profile need to understand in order to interoperate.
   For example: the number and type of claims, which serialisation
   format, the supported signature schemes, etc.  EATs carry an in-band
   profile identifier using the eat_profile claim (see Section 4.3.2 of
   [EAT]).  The value of the eat_profile claim is either an OID or a
   URI.

   The media types defined in this document include an optional
   eat_profile parameter that can be used to mirror the homonymous claim
   of the transported EAT.  Exposing the EAT profile at the API layer
   allows API routers to dispatch payloads directly to the profile-
   specific processor without having to snoop into the request bodies.
   This design also provides a finer-grained and scalable type system
   that matches the inherent extensibility of EAT.  The expectation
   being that a certain EAT profile automatically obtains a media type
   derived from the base (e.g., application/eat+cwt) by populating the
   eat_profile parameter with the corresponding OID or URL.

4.  Examples

   The example in Figure 3 illustrates the usage of EAT media types for
   transporting attestation evidence as well as negotiating the
   acceptable format of the attestation result.

   # NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

   POST /challenge-response/v1/session/1234567890 HTTP/1.1
   Host: verifier.example
   Accept: application/eat+cwt; eat_profile="tag:ar4si.example,2021"
   Content-Type: application/eat+cwt; \
                 eat_profile="tag:evidence.example,2022"

   [ CBOR-encoded EAT w/ eat_profile="tag:evidence.example,2022" ]

             Figure 3: Example REST Verification API (request)

   The example in Figure 4 illustrates the usage of EAT media types for
   transporting attestation results.

   # NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/eat+cwt; \
                 eat_profile="tag:ar4si.example,2021"

   [ CBOR-encoded EAT w/ eat_profile="tag:ar4si.example,2021" ]

             Figure 4: Example REST Verification API (response)

   In both cases, a tag URI [RFC4151] identifying the profile is carried
   as an explicit parameter.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security consideration of [EAT] and [UCCS] apply in full.

6.  IANA Considerations


   // RFC Editor: please replace RFCthis with this RFC number and remove
   // this note.

6.1.  +cwt Structured Syntax Suffix

   IANA is requested to register the +cwt structured syntax suffix in
   the "Structured Syntax Suffixes" registry
   [IANA.media-type-structured-suffix] in the manner described in
   [MediaTypes], which can be used to indicate that the media type is
   encoded as a CWT.

   Name:  CBOR Web Token (CWT)

      fragment identification syntax defined for application/cwt.)
